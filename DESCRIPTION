Description: Conversion of characters in various legacy Vietnamese text encodings to their correct Unicode characters in UTF-8 encoding. These Vietnamese encodings (TCVN3, VNI, VPS, VISCII) are not natively supported in R and lead to printing of wrong characters (Mojibake). This package fixes that problem and provides output with or without diacritics.

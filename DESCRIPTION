Description: Conversion of characters in various legacy Vietnamese text encodings to their correct Unicode characters. These Vietnamese encodings (TCVN3, VPS, VISCII) are not natively supported in R and lead to printing of wrong characters and garbled text (Mojibake). This package fixes that problem and provides output with or without diacritics.
